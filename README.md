## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - SCSS Languaje


### What I learned

In this exerecise, I was focused in less use of HTML class atribute, and using in CSS automatic selectors like `*:nth-child():`. 

### Continued development

I am focusing in learning and improve useful tricks on CSS, to make better look pages, animations, and impressive visual effects.
